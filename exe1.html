      <h2>Mango is a Superhero of Fruit!</h3>
        <p>If mangoes could be any more of a nutritional hero, they might need to wear capes.</p>
        <p>The luscious, sweet tropical fruits are packed with so many vitamins and minerals they are great for
          our hearts, skin, eyes, and digestive and immune systems.</p>
        <p>Packing more than 20 vitamins and minerals, including high doses of vitamins A and C, mangoes hail
          from the cashew family and are also low-fat – one whole mango is about 207 calories.<br /> One cup
          of sliced mango is about 165 calories, and provides nearly 70% of the recommended daily intake of
          vitamin C, which improves iron absorption, helps defend cells from damage and aids the immune
          system.</p>

      <h2>The National Dessert of the Thais - Mango Sticky Rice </h2>
      <p>Mango sticky rice is a healthy and satisfying dessert featuring sweet gooey sticky rice served with a
        luscious coconut sauce and sliced mango.<br /> It is a popular Thai dessert that you can easily find at
        most Thai restaurants. But the homemade version contains less sugar, tastes just as satisfying, and is
        quite easy to prepare.<br /> Now that mango is in season, I’ve been making this dessert often at home.
